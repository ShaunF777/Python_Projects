ElevenLabs Text-to-Speech: Basic Voice Generator

Description:
-------------
This script uses the ElevenLabs Text-to-Speech API to convert a short sentence into a realistic
spoken audio file using a selected voice. ElevenLabs provides high-quality, natural-sounding
voices (male and female) and allows voice customization.

Dependencies:
-------------
- Python 3.x
- `requests` module (Install with: `pip install requests`)
- Internet connection
- A valid ElevenLabs API key

Limitations:
-------------
- API key required (free and paid tiers available at https://www.elevenlabs.io/)
- Rate limits apply depending on your subscription
- Voice list must be fetched or manually selected from available voice IDs

How to Change the Voice:
-------------
1. Visit: https://api.elevenlabs.io/docs to explore available voices
2. Log in to your ElevenLabs account and get your API key
3. Use the `/v1/voices` endpoint to list all voice IDs and names
4. Replace the `voice_id` in the script below with your desired one
